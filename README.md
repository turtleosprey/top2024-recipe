Hello! I am Rovic, it is nice that I am just a quarter through the Fundamentals course in The Odin Project

In this project, I am doing:
- A recipe website with basic links, images, and texts

In the first chapter, I learnt:
- The basics of GIT and how it is connected to GitHub if you wish to
- Internet

In HTML, I learnt:
- Noopener and noreferrer; for privacy and security concerns
- Description lists
- href stands for hyperreference
