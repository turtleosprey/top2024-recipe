        <li> 2 tsp baking powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg </li>
        <li> 190ml (3/4 cup) buttermilk </li>
        <li> 2 eggs, lightly whisked </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
        <li> 35g packet Hubba Bubba Groovy Grape Flavour, finely chopped </li>
        <li> 60ml (1/4 cup) thickened cream </li>
        <li> 230g (1 1/2 cups) pure icing sugar, sifted </li>

      <dt> <strong> Steps </strong> </dt>
      <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 220Â°C/200Â°C fan forced. Lightly grease a 12-hole (1/4 cup) doughnut pan with cooking spray. </li>
        <li> Sift flour, sugar, baking powder and nutmeg into a large bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, and oil. Mix until just combined. Pipe into the prepared holes, two-thirds full. Bake for 7-9 minutes or until doughnuts spring back when lightly touched. Set aside for 1 minute to cool before turning onto a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
        <li> To make the glaze, place bubblegum and cream in a small heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Stir until bubblegum has softened. Use the back of a spoon to break up any unmelted pieces and stir until smooth and well combined. Remove from heat. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool. Stir in icing sugar and 1-2 tablespoons of water until glaze is thickened and a ribbon trail forms when the spoon is lifted. </li>
        <li> Use food gel to tint glaze mauve. Add several extra drops to create a darker shade. Gently stir to create a ripple effect. Dip the doughnuts in glaze and allow excess to drip off. Place on a wire rack to set. Decorate with gold leaf. </li>
      </ol>
